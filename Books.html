<h2>2023</h2>

<div class="book-review">
    <p><strong>Rory Stuart—Politics on the Edge</strong></p>
    <p class="review-text">A not-so-optimistic-review of what is wrong with British politics. Rory has the property of somehow being right on every issue despite being a raging royalist. Worth reading. </p>

<h2>2022</h2>

<div class="book-review">
    <p><strong>Peter Zeihan—The End of the World Is Just the Beginning: Mapping the Collapse of Globalization</strong></p>
    <p class="review-text"> A prescient book that goes, somewhat hyperbolically, some way to help you understand how the world order is faltering from the status quo of the last almost century. Strongly recommended. <br> All of Zeihan's work would benefit from more references and some critical takes from others. </p>
