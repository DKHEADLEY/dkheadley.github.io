        <h1>The small web </h1>

        I am something of a twitter addict. This has, for most of my life, been an at least somewhat positive force. The information density one could derive from a well-curated twitter feed at its best was certainly impressive.
        <p>So I am going to try and write some things here, if anything just to have some self-accountable blog. On a basic level, I think the function of a blog like this should be to link to other things which are small and not so well advertised. If enough places can do this, then there can be an interconnected internet in which one can navigate without the use of platforms like twitter.
        <p>So I would like to mention some links to things I find interesting. Most of these are nodes, so a small website can't be particularly interesting, but:
        
        <p>  <a href="https://jeremymaluf.com/onebag/" target="_blank">Jeremy Maluf has a post </a> he updates every couple of years with the contents of a single backpack with which he travels the world. Not featured is the fact that you need to build, sell a company and be excessively rich to have this lifestyle work for you.
        
        <p> <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/06/20/backpack.html" target="_blank"> Etherium founder Vitalik </a> has a similar blog where he as a less dignified version. I find it not to be a coincidence that the factor that facilitates these lifestyles are more the extreme wealth than the small number of items in a bag.
