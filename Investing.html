      <h1> Investing </h1>
    <p> I like index funds like half of the internet. There is good reason to believe that index funds are the best strategy, and that a 100% allocation to them over bonds is optimal for someone young person.</p>
    
    <p> Diversification is a free lunch. Imagine someone knows nothing about two stocks. The have two prices $$p_1,\,\,p_2 $$
    In what proportion should they buy the two stocks? To know the answer to this question, only knowing the historic prices of these assets, we need to create a model.
